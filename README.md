# Trace Formulation
This repo contains the codes for the trace formulation example problems, which is related to the following paper:
- W. Yao, F. Verdugo, R. E. Christiansen, and S. G. Johnson, “Trace formulation for photonic inverse design with incoherent sources,” arXiv.org e-Print archive, arXiv:2111.13046, November 2021

For the three numerical examples discussed in the paper, it corresponds to the following folders respectively:
- Fluorescent particle --- AveragedSE
- Periodic emitting surface --- Periodic
- Coupling into a waveguide --- Waveguide

The folder `Module` contains a module that is used for the electromagnetic problem.
